    <h1>untitled</h1>
    <pre>
                i try to put into words
                what summer means to me.
                warm nights beneath blueish cloud and greenish tree
                you sing to me.
    </pre>
    <br>
    <pre>
    i sit pretty on a tattered bench
    my legs stick, my hands cold and tingly with that springy night chill
    the man with the guitar strums with his fingers and his gentle warbling tongue.

    <pre class="stanza" >


                    the little people pass and sing their praises
                    in the form of whistles and claps
                    i bask
                    he plays one last song
                    i sweat out the morning and wave in the eve.
